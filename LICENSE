ORIGIN AND PERMISSION NOTICE

This repository is a Rust port of "multisensor-lmb-filters" originally authored
by Stuart Robertson (https://github.com/scjrobertson/multisensor-lmb-filters).
The original work was published without an explicit license file.

The original author was notified that unlicensed code defaults to "all rights
reserved" and was asked to select licensing terms. Rather than selecting a
specific license, the author granted broader permission, stating: "You're free
to do whatever you want with the code." This exchange occurred via Slack on
the 28th and 29th of November 2025.

Based on this permission, this port is released under the MIT License.
