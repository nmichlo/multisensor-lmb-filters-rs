**IMPORTANT**

- REMEMBER, PUSH BACK AND NOTIFY ME IF WHILE INVESTIGATING ISSUES YOU NOTICE WEIRD HACKS TO
GET EQUIVLANENCE WITH THE MATLAB CODE. ALSO PUSH BACK IF 100% EQUIVALENCE IS NOT WORTH
ACHEIVING, BUT WE CAN TEST THE ALGORITHM IS WORKING IN OTHER WAYS?

- REMEMBER, if you make changes to common code in rust, you might break other algorithms. It seems like in rust we de-duplicated assuming behavior was the same. Just remember to run tests or add branches for code that actually needs to differ

- REMEMBER grep/find/cat/xargs are BANNED, instead use `fd` and `rg`
